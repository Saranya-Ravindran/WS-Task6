# üèè Live Cricket Score Extractor using Selenium

A Python-based automation tool that leverages Selenium to extract real-time cricket match scores from a live sports website and stores the data in an Excel file. This script is designed for seamless data collection and reporting.

## üìò Project Overview

This project automates the process of collecting live cricket match data using the **Selenium WebDriver**. It navigates to a live scores page, scrapes structured information about ongoing matches, and exports the results into an Excel spreadsheet (`livescore.xlsx`) using **Pandas**.

## ‚úÖ Key Highlights

- Fully automated browser interaction using Selenium.
- Captures live match details: team names, scores, and match status.
- Data structured and exported in Excel format for further analysis/reporting.
- No manual effort required post execution.
